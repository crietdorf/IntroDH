## The Style of Shakespeare

Shakespeare is often said to have a unique style. At the same time, there are numerous authorship debates that question whether Shakespeare is the author of some plays that are commonly attributed to him. Can we use stylometry to identify a unique style of the bard as compared to his contemporaries (Christopher Marlowe, Ben Johnson, etc.)
