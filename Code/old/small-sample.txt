Here Master: What cheer?


Good: Speak to the Mariners: fall to it, yarely, or we run our selves a
ground, bestirre, bestirre


Heigh my hearts, cheerely, cheerely my hearts: yare, yare: Take in the
toppe-sale: Tend to the Masters whistle: Blow till thou burst thy wind, if
room enough


Good Boteswain^ have care: where is the Master? Play the men.


I pray now keep below.
